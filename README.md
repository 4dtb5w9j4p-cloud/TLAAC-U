# The Legal Advisory Aid Camp — Static Website

This is a simple static website for *The Legal Advisory Aid Camp*, created to provide free legal aid and research about Uganda's legal framework.

## Included files
- `index.html` — home page
- `about.html` — about the project
- `research.html` — research list
- `contact.html` — contact details
- `styles.css` — styling
- `logo.svg` — logo (scale of justice)

## How to publish for free

### Option A — GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public).
2. Upload all files (you can drag-and-drop in the web UI).
3. In repository settings → Pages, set the source to the root branch (`main` or `master`) and save.
4. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

### Option B — Netlify (drag-and-drop)
1. Go to https://www.netlify.com and sign up.
2. On the Sites dashboard, "Add new site" → "Deploy manually" → drag-and-drop the site folder (zip).
3. Netlify will publish a free site at a `netlify.app` domain.

### Option C — Vercel
1. Sign up at https://vercel.com and import from GitHub.
2. Select framework as "Other" and deploy — it's free for static sites.

## Custom domain
You can add a custom domain from your domain registrar — both GitHub Pages and Netlify support custom domains and SSL.

## Notes / Next steps
- Replace example contact details with your real contact info.
- If you want a contact form that stores messages, you'll need a backend or a service (Formspree, Netlify Forms).
- I can customize copy, add pages, or produce Word/PDF guides for clinics.
